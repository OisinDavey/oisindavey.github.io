Our website is up and running!  

Here we plan to document the events and activities of the physics and chemistry society, to publish documents and resources for members & non-members alike, and to honor the natural science tradition of maintaining a static site. For your convenience, there are (as of writing this) three views in which to view the pages displayed here.

It's only a few weeks ago that this society was founded, and our committee established. See our [mission statement](/mission_statement) for more details.
