### Hiya!

My name is Oisín (with a fada); I'm studying to become a physicist/mathematician/something or other at Maynooth University, Ireland.  

### Hobbies/Interests

I have the default set of hobbies & interests for a physics undergrad: on the "In a band"/"Rock climbs" spectrum, I'm more musically inclined. I'm a big fan of Mitski, KKB, They might be giants, Tally Hall, The Divine Comedy and Autoheart. I've had great success at trying my best-est to play instruments, although going further with these attempts hasn't panned out.  

I have a TBR pile stretching back to 2019, mostly novels. Main problem is that I'm too busy reading textbooks to read for fun. Opinion on the greek classics: The Odyssey is great, the Iliad is _terrible_, and the Aeneid is pretty good. Source? The odyessy has cool boat adventures, while the greeks and trojans never even leave Ilium!! The horse isn't even in the book. See my goodreads [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/165521661-ois-n-davey) to see my incredibly biased opinions; ignore that my average book rating is 4.5 stars, I feel guilty leaving bad reviews and also I don't finish books that I don't like.

Puzzles, bugaboos, quandries and dilemmas? _Love'em_. I used to focus in on competitive programming when I was younger, which served as my main aspiration. Now though, I tend to be less focussed and more diversified, so I like fun maths problems, latin square puzzles, crosswords, etc. Although usually I like to study puzzles that can be analysed for their mathematical properties, like sudoku or hashiwokakero. Also do local speedquizzing with a team every other week.
