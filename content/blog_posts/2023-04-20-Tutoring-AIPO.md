I've been once again invited to tutor the students at the AIPO TST. This is an annual training camp and competition taking place over the course of a week in the summer where prospective contestants will compete to represent the country internationally in the IOI; more importantly, however, this is a week for the candidates to hang out in person and to train. I'm very happy to be tutoring this year as I was last year because [I'm a big believer the idea of the AIPO](/blog_posts/2023-04-17-irlcpc-reflection/). Incredibly conveniently, I will be doing an optoelectronics fellowship with Tyndall _on UCC campus_ so I won't have to travel or organise accommodation. This year's candidates are second to none and are very dedicated to their studies so I'll struggle to find something to teach them about!

In similar news, I've just now been informed that Maynooth CSsoc will be hosting an intra-varsity team programming contest here on May 2nd. Very excited to attend although it does mean I have to form a team. I don't _really_ know if there are any other competitive programmers here? (Although maybe I don't count as a competitive programmer anymore; competitive programmer emeritus would be more accurate).
