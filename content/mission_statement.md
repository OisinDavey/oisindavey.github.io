Black holes, quantum mechanics, x-rays, nuclear fusion, liquid nitrogen, supernovae, special relativity, rocket science, all of biology, all of engineering, none of sociology, metaphysics, particle accelerators, cosmology, applied philosophy, stargazing, ooblek!

If you like those things ^ then you either like physics and chemistry, or you haven't figured out that you like physics and chemistry yet (there's still time for you!)

Join us for pub quizzes, guest speakers, networking, museum trips, food, stargazing, and to talk about all things in the study of matter.
